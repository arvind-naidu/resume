## BBC processes

Mainly my work at the BBC involves the following processes and tools…

- Ruby (BDD Acceptance Tests with Cucumber/Capybara)
- PHP (Web Application with Zend Framework)
- Mobile first/Responsive web design and performance architecture 
- Modular JavaScript (AMD based using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org))
- Object-Oriented CSS (specifically the [BEM](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/maintainable-css-with-bem/) methodology)
- Sass pre-processor
- Efficient and well structured HTML
- Git Version Control
- Running [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) work environment
- Writing custom Grunt tasks to handle different tooling requirements
- Agile/Scrum project management
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## BBC highlights so far…

- Voted "Developer of the Year 2013"
- Lead the development of the new responsive navigation for BBC News.
- Invited to speak at the W3C Responsive Images meet-up in Paris alongside speakers and participants from Google, Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, Opera, W3C and Akamai (event hosted by Mozilla)
  - [Slides from my talk](https://speakerdeck.com/integralist/bbc-news-responsive-images)
- Being nominated to become a member of the BBC's GEL Responsive Working Group
- Integrating the new BBC UX framework (e.g. part of which meant incorporating a new multi break-point grid system with custom JS overlay to aid development)
- [Open-sourcing and rewriting/automating the BBC's core responsive image technique](https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/)
  - Also [writing a blog post about my rewrite and open-sourcing of Imager.js on the BBC's "Responsive News" Blog](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/58244240772/imager-js-previously-tom-maslen-wrote-a-quick)
- Writing PhantomJS prototype to automate the generation of an Application Cache manifest for offline support
  - I wrote a [blog post](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/generate-application-cache-manifest-with-phantomjs/) and [open-sourced the project](https://github.com/Integralist/Squirrel)
- Developing a design pattern library for modular/responsive components 
  - this then evolved into my open-source side project called [Stark](https://github.com/Integralist/Stark) (see [my blog post about it](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/stark-simplified-separation-of-components-into-decoupled-applications/))
- Porting JavaScript test suite originally using QUnit over to Jasmine BDD along with Sinon.js and corresponding Jasmine Adapter (easing bugs and allowing developers to be more expressive)
- Simplifying over-engineered Sass/CSS architecture
- Building new [Sass image function using Ruby which takes a URL argument and returns a Base64 encoded string](https://github.com/Integralist/Sass-Base64-Extension) (also works around IE8 > 32kb bug)
- Refactoring large chunks of code (e.g. ~600 loc Sass mixin to a working 7 loc mixin)
- Helping other BBC teams to utilise new build tool technology (i.e. [Grunt.js](https://github.com/Integralist/Grunt-Boilerplate))
- Co-building the BBC News touch interaction photo gallery feature
- Giving a [presentation](https://slid.es/markmcdonnell/) on existing BBC News strategies and how they can be improved.

## Extended skill set

But my skill set expands to include…

- Practical Code Design and Architecture 
	(I love 'sequence' diagrams to explain interfaces and message communications)
- [Vim (my code editor of choice)](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/a-guide-to-getting-started-with-vim/)
  - I followed up that blog post with a [Vim work flow](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/vim-workflow/) post.
- Regular Expressions
- [Unix command line (Awk, Sed, Grep etc)](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/unix-commands/)
- Node.js
- [Grunt task-based command line build tool](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/grunt-boilerplate/)
- Code performance and optimisation knowledge
- JS libraries such as Ender & jQuery, along with the [MVC extension Backbone](http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/mvc-in-javascript-with-backbone-js/)
- Developing my own libraries and code bases, writing [style guides](https://github.com/Integralist/Style-Guides) etc
- ActionScript 3.0 (although I'm happy to report I've not needed to use it for a few years now)
- In a past life I used to write code in Classic ASP and an early ASP.NET

## Other achievements

.NET magazine asked me to write an article for a new feature they're introducing (comparing DalekJS and CasperJS).  
This will be going to print the end of November 2013.

## Previously

Prior to the BBC I worked for a creative agency called [Storm Creative](http://stormcreative.co.uk) from February 2001 - December 2012.

At Storm I was a technical lead under the role of 'Digital Media Manager' which included the following responsibilities… 

- Programming
	- front-end development
	- prototyping using latest tools and technologies
- Managing 'Digital Media' Department
	- Delegating work to staff (programmers)
	- Ensuring work is done on time
	- Handling staff questions/issues
	- Managing clients
	- Invoicing
	- Server management (Apache)
- Project Manager
	- Meeting with clients and understanding requirements
	- Booking in work with different departments (creative, copy writing)
	- Creating schematics/architecture of applications
	
Storm had carried out a lot of work for the NHS, Art Council, local government as well as local businesses and a two year long project called [LickList](http://www.licklist.co.uk). 

In 2012 Storm started work on a financial business venture called [Money Republic](https://moneyrepublic.com) which I was involved with the stage one build and over saw the project's technical architecture (pushing for the mobile first development process and responsive web design aspects), but it was my team who were responsible for the programming of most of the site with the exception of the home page's core feature which was a loan application widget which was heavily JavaScript based (along with other JavaScript heavy widgets throughout the site). 

Note: since leaving Storm the code base for Money Republic has changed significantly I'm afraid so much of what I had developed is no longer in use.

While managing the Digital Media Department I looked after a team of developers (two back-end and two front-end). After two years one of our front-end devs took the skills I had passed onto him and had managed to acquire a role at the London/American agency [Mint](http://mintdigital.com).

##Summary

I ideally want to get across two fundamental things about me:

1. I'm very passionate about programming and the openness of the web.
2. I love getting the chance to learn and experience new things.
